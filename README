digfe README

digfe is a free, GUI 'front end' for the DNS client program 'dig'. digfe strives
to simplify the operation of 'dig' via a user friendly GUI interface presenting
a functional layout of almost all of dig's many options. Query's can be saved or
loaded for later reference.

digfe supports virtually all of dig's many features and command line parameters.
Probably the most notably lacking feature at this point is 'batch' or 'file'
operation. This may be included in a later version if enough user demand is
there.

digfe was developed on Linux using Visual TCL 1.5.2 and should, therefore, run
under any OS that supports tcl/tk including all versions of Linux/Unix, Windows,
NT, 2000, etc. You do not need 'Visual Tcl' to run 'digfe' but you do need 
tcl/tk or, at a minimum, the tcl/tk interpreter, a.k.a. 'wish'.

Other than tcl/tk, 'digfe' requires the package 'Itcl 3.0', package 'Itk 3.0',
package 'Iwidgets 3.0', and the program	'dig' to be available on your system 
in the search path for executables. The 'Itcl' and 'Itk" packages are included
in the standard install of most distros that include tcl/tk, e.g. RedHat.
As for 'IWidgets', it is included with most distros that include tcl/tk but it
isn't always part of the base installation, so you may have to *dig* a little 
to find it (pun intended), or you can always find it at 
http://www.scriptics.com home of tcl/tk. Follow the links to 'Itcl'.
