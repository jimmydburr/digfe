PLEASE NOTE: This code is from 2001 and is posted here for reference only. At
this time the code will work on debian with tcl8.5, Itcl 3, Itk 3, and Iwidgets 4.

digfe INSTALL Instructions

1. At this time there are no digfe RPM packages. Please let me know if you know of
someone who might be available to package digfe as an RPM for redistribution.

2. 'digfe' requires the following tcl/tk related packages 'Itcl 3.0', 'Itk 3.0',
'Iwidgets 3.0', and, of course, the program 'dig'. dig should be available on 
your system in the search path for executables, i.e. /usr/bin. The 'Itcl' and 
'Itk" packages are included in the standard install of most distros that 
include tcl/tk, e.g. RedHat. As for 'IWidgets', it is included with most distros 
that include tcl/tk but it isn't always part of the base installation, so you 
may have to *dig* a little to find it (pun intended), or you can always find it 
at http://www.scriptics.com home of tcl/tk. Follow the links to 'Itcl'.

3. Installing digfe is easy. Assuming you have downloaded a tar ball (e.g.
digfe-0.7.3.tar.gz) simply gunzip and untar into the directory of your choice.

Example: (as root)
# cd /usr/local/share
# tar -xvzf digfe-0.7.3.tar.gz
..insure that the source file is executable..
# cd digfe-0.7.3
# chmod +x digfe-0.7.3.tcl
..you may wish to add a symbolic link somewhere in your path..
# ln -s /usr/local/share/digfe-0.7.3/digfe-0.7.3.tcl /usr/bin/digfe

4. You should now be able to execute digfe.

Example:
$ digfe (and press enter)
